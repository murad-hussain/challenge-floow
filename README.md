# challenge-floow
Demonstrating proficiency of using git
Submission:
Complete source code is uploaded on this repository.
An executable jar can be found in the target folder which takes the name "Challenge-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar". Note that due to unavailability of time, running from the command line arguments functionality has not been placed.
A test file named "input.txt" that contains text is placed in the src folder and the application stores the result to the "output.txt" can be found in the same folder.
Code related to save the result to mongoDB is commented out since due to the shortage of time I could not manage to solve dependency conflict between spring and java driver for mongoDB.
This project is the maven project thus source code can be clone and can be built using maven.
CountWordMain is the class that allows to run the application and to save result to the output.txt file.
