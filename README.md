Demonstrating proficiency of using git
Submission:
Complete source code can be found on this repository.
An executable jar can be found in the target folder which takes the name "Challenge-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar". Note that due to unavailability of time, running from the command line arguments functionality has not been placed.
A test file named "input.txt" that contains text is placed in the src folder and the application stores the result to the "output.txt" can be found in the same folder.
Connection to mongodb is made by passing URI connection string as argument to MongoClientURI however IP address to access mongodb server is 151.64.109.199/32. On local environment mongodb can be accessed through 127.0.0.1:27017
This project is the maven project thus source code can be clone and built using maven.
CountWordMain is the class that allows to run the application and to save result to the output.txt file (just for verification purposes) and eventually to mongodb server.
